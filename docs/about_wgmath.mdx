**wgmath** is a set of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) libraries exposing re-usable GPU shaders for scientific computing including:
- Linear algebra.
- AI (Large Language Models).
- Collision-detection.
- Rigid-body physics.
- Non-rigid physics.
By targeting WebGPU, these libraries run on most GPUs, including on mobile and on the web. It aims to promote open and
cross-platform GPU computing for scientific applications, a field currently strongly dominated by proprietary solutions
(like CUDA).

All of the libraries are still under heavy development and might be lacking some important features. Contributions are
welcome!

The **wgcore** crate part of the **wgmath** ecosystem exposes a set of proc-macros to facilitate sharing and composing
shaders across Rust libraries.
