:::note
The code described in this section can be run from the
[**timestamp_queries.rs**](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/blob/main/crates/wgcore/examples/timestamp_queries.rs) example with
`cargo run --features derive --example timestamp_queries`. Complete source code is also provided at the
[end of this page](#complete-example).

:::danger Unstable feature
Timestamp queries are a bit impractical to use at the moment. Their API is still being worked on.
:::

Timestamp queries aim to answer the question: "How long did this compute operation run on the GPU?" It is
essentially a basic, occasionally unreliable, benchmarking tools that measure shader runtimes. This is achieved by:
 1. Instructing the GPU to insert timestamps at specific locations of the execution pipeline.
 2. Instructing the GPU to resolve the queries.
 3. Reading back the timestamp values from GPU memory to CPU land.
 4. Converting the timestamps to milliseconds and subtracting them to obtain the runtimes.

 Platform support for timestamp queries can be very limited so it is advised to not abort the execution of your
 application if they are not supported.

:::info
Be sure to enable the `wgpu::Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY` feature when initializing your gpu device
(in `DeviceDescriptor::required_features`).

The `wgcore` crate exposes the [`GpuTimestamps`](https://docs.rs/wgcore/latest/wgcore/timestamps/struct.GpuTimestamps.html)
structure that helps with all the four steps mentioned above:

```rust
// Initialize a query set that can contain up to 2 timestamps
// (here we need only 2 timestamps since we are measuring a single compute pass).
let mut timestamps = GpuTimestamps::new(gpu.device(), 2);

// Initialize the invocation queue as usual.
let mut queue = KernelInvocationQueue::new(gpu.device());

// ## Step 1 ##
// Start a compute pass with a custom name. The `true` indicates that timestamps
// will have to be pushed for this pass.
queue.compute_pass("timestamp_queries_test", true);

// TODO: queue one or multiple kernels here.

let mut encoder = gpu.device().create_command_encoder(&Default::default());

// ## STEP 1 (bis) ##
// When encoding the queue, pass the `GpuTimestamps` to actually create our timestamps.
// Note that if `None` is given instead, timestamps will be ignored.
queue.encode(&mut encoder, Some(&mut timestamps));

// ## STEP 2 ##
// Resolve the timestamp queries.
timestamps.resolve(&mut encoder);

// Submit the calculations.
gpu.queue().submit(Some(encoder.finish()));

// ## STEP 3 & 4 ##
// Read back the timestamp values, in milliseconds.
// The compute passâ€™s runtime is given by `timestamps_read[1] - timestamps_read[2]`.
let timestamps_read = timestamps.wait_for_results_ms(gpu.device(), gpu.queue());
```

Each compute pass requires **2 timestamps** for measuring their runtime: one for when the pass _starts_, and one for when its
_ends_. The actual runtime of the compute pass is the difference between the two.

Note that there is currently no way to know which timestamp is related to which compute pass unless you know exactly in
which order all the calls to `queue.compute_pass` happened: their timestamps will be in the same order.


:::note
The examples in this page only work on a native program. On WASM, reading the timestamps from the gpu can be a bit more
convoluted due the async nature of web platforms. See how it is being done in the [`wgsparkl`](https://github.com/dimforge/wgsparkl)
crate as an example.
