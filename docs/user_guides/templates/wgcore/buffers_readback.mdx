:::note
The code described in this section can be run from the
[**buffer_readback.rs**](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/blob/main/crates/wgcore/examples/buffer_readback.rs) example with
`cargo run --features derive --example buffer_readback`. Complete source code is also provided at the
[end of this page](#complete-example).

After our buffer have been [initialized](./buffers_initialization.mdx), and our compute kernels have run, you might need
to read the results back to RAM for further processing on the CPU side. Reading the content of a GPU buffer require a
few steps:
1. Be sure that the buffer you want to read from was initialized with `BufferUsages::COPY_SRC`:
```rust
let buffer_to_read_from = GpuVector::init(
    gpu.device(),
    &buffer_data,
    BufferUsages::STORAGE | BufferUsages::COPY_SRC,
);
```
2. Be sure that a _staging buffer_ was created with `BufferUsages::COPY_DST | BufferUsages::MAP_READ`. This is an
   intermediate buffer that can be mapped to the CPU-side virtual memory:
```rust
let staging_buffer = GpuVector::uninit(
    gpu.device(),
    buffer_data.len(),
    BufferUsages::COPY_DST | BufferUsages::MAP_READ,
);
```
3. Instruct the GPU to copy the content of your buffer into the _staging buffer_:
```rust
staging_buffer.copy_from(&mut encoder, &buffer_to_read_from);
```
4. Read the staging buffer into a vector of typed values.
```rust
let buffer_read_from_gpu = staging.read(gpu.device()).await;
```

Note that the staging buffer can be uninitialized considering its will never be read before being written to
by `staging_buffer.copy_from`. The length provided to `GpuVector::uninit` is the number of (typed) elements
the buffer can contain, not the size in bytes.
