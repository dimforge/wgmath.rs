:::note
The code described in this section can be run from the
[**hot_reloading.rs**](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/blob/main/crates/wgcore/examples/hot_reloading.rs) example with
`cargo run --features derive --example hot_reloading`. Complete source code is also provided at the
[end of this page](#complete-example).
:::

Hot-reloading lets you edit and apply changes to your WGSL shaders while the application using them is running. This
enables quick iterations and debugging on existing shaders without needing to rebuild and restart the application.
When using `wgcore` (and its [`derive(Shader)`](./composing_shaders.mdx)) to associate a `.wgsl` file to a rust struct,
it is possible to benefit from hot-reloading with very little boilerplate:

```rust
// Initialize the gpu device and queue.
let gpu = GpuInstance::new().await?;
// Detects file changes.
let mut hot_reload = HotReloadState::new()?;
// Register the shader for hot-reloading.
MyShader::watch_sources(&mut hot_reload)?;
// Instantiate the compute pipeline.
let mut compute_pipeline = MyShader::from_device(gpu.device())?;

// This can be, for example, your game loop or window event loop.
loop {
    // Detects file changes since the last call to `update_changes`.
    hot_reload.update_changes();
    // Reload the compute pipeline if it changed.
    compute_pipeline.reload_if_changed(gpu.device(), &hot_reload);
}
```

## How does this work?

Say you are working on an application’s code (like, for example, one of the examples of
[wgsparkl](https://github.com/dimforge/wgsparkl)), and depends on local version of its dependencies (like
[wgebra](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath)) using a [cargo patch](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html).
Using the code snippet from the previous section, you can leverage hot-reloading on **any** shader, even the ones
from the local dependencies. The `derive(Shader)` macros will automatically figure out the absolute path of all the
shaders at compile-time so the can be watched with `Shader::watch_sources`.

:::danger
This automatic detection of shader paths might not work properly if you run your application from a directory that is
different from the root of the rust workspace it is built from. This is due to some limitations in the Rust libraries
that will hopefully be stabilized in future versions of the compiler.
:::

This won’t work for shaders of a dependency that is not available locally on your machine, since there is no way to
actual shader file that could be modified (since they are embedded in the library directly). In order to make it work
for these shaders, you can [overwrite them](./overwriting_shaders.mdx) with a local version of the shader by specifying
their path with `Shader::set_wgsl_path`. After their path is overwritten, `Shader::watch_sources` needs to be called
and hot-reloading will work.

:::tip
If your shader depends on other shaders with `shader(derive(...))`, then calling `Shader::watch_sources` on the
top-level shader will automatically register all its dependencies as well for hot-reloading :fire:
